# Shell Script Usage Guide

## Overview

This repository contains a shell script designed to automate certain tasks or functions. Shell scripts are a powerful way to manage system administration, automate repetitive tasks, or configure your environment. This guide will help you understand how to use the shell script provided in this repository.

## Prerequisites

Before using the shell script, make sure you have the following:

- A **Unix-based** operating system (Linux, macOS, or WSL for Windows).
- Basic knowledge of shell commands and the terminal.
- **Bash** (or a compatible shell) installed.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using `git`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

2. Make the Script Executable
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory containing the script. If the script is not executable by default, you need to make it executable by running:
```
chmod +x script-name.sh
```

## Run the Script
Now, you can execute the shell script by running the following command:
```
./script-name.sh
```
If the script requires root privileges, you may need to use sudo:

```
sudo ./script-name.sh
```

## Customize Parameters (if applicable)
Some shell scripts may have customizable options or parameters. If the script accepts arguments, you can pass them when running the script:

```
./script-name.sh argument1 argument2
```

Check the scriptâ€™s documentation or the script itself for details about available parameters.

## Troubleshooting
Ensure that the script has the correct permissions.
If you see permission errors, try running the script with sudo (if necessary).
Check the terminal output for any specific error messages and adjust the script or system configuration accordingly.

For example, if you have a script named backup.sh, the usage might look like:
```
chmod +x backup.sh
./backup.sh /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

This would run the script with source and destination directories as arguments.
